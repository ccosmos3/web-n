          1 Introduction
            1.1 Purpose
            This document defines the CTIA Certification Program requirements for Cybersecurity Certification of managed Internet of Things (IoT) devices. For the purpose of this document, an IoT device contains an IoT application layer that provides identity and authentication functionality and at least one communications module supporting 5G, 4G LTE Wi-Fi®.
            1.2 Scope
            This document includes the requirements and processes of the CTIA Cybersecurity Certification Program (“Program”) for IoT devices. An IoT device connects to at least one network to exchange data with other devices, vehicles, home appliances, infrastructure elements, etc. The device might include hardware, software, sensors, actuators and network connectivity. Tests are defined in the CTIA Cybersecurity Certification Test Plan for IoT Devices (“Test Plan”) [1].
            While the Program covers a wide range of requirements, network operators may require compliance with additional specifications and tests to satisfy their unique security requirements. It is highly recommended to understand the target operator’s security requirements prior to seeking certification.
            The Program is defined in three levels. The first level identifies core IoT device security features; and the second and third levels identify security elements of increasing device complexity, sophistication and manageability.
            Testing assumes that the device provides an execution environment for IoT applications that makes use of the 5G or 4G LTE communications module and/or the Wi-Fi communications module. If the IoT application is not associated with at least one of these communications modules, then the device architecture is out of scope of this document. If the IoT application supports more than one of these communications modules, then tests that involve network communications shall be tested with each supported communications module to ensure the same security features are available for all network environments.
            Many different mechanisms may be used to achieve the security goals. The IoT device manufacturer (OEM) may select the mechanisms that are deemed most relevant for the intended market. One of the goals of this document is to make sure the widest adopted standards are used to ensure compatibility across cybersecurity systems. The Test Plan [1] mandates a number of standards: AES key size standards, end-to-end encryption standards, syslog standards, etc. These are intended to allow for a baseline of security standards that are compatible with most systems.
            This document assumes minimum support for encryption based on AES with a 128-bit key. Support for this algorithm and key size by all devices provides an interoperable cryptographic capability; however, devices may also support other algorithms and key sizes that provide the same or more cryptographic security.
