          features; and the second and third levels identify security elements of increasing device complexity, sophistication and manageability.
          Testing assumes that the device provides an execution environment for IoT applications that makes use of the 5G or 4G LTE communications module and/or the Wi-Fi communications module. If the IoT application is not associated with at least one of these communications modules, then the device architecture is out of scope of this document. If the IoT application supports more than one of these communications modules, then tests that involve network communications shall be tested with each supported communications module to ensure the same security features are available for all network environments.
          Many different mechanisms may be used to achieve the security goals. The IoT device manufacturer (OEM) may select the mechanisms that are deemed most relevant for the intended market. One of the goals of this document is to make sure the widest adopted standards are used to ensure compatibility across cybersecurity systems. The Test Plan [1] mandates a number of standards: AES key size standards, end-to-end encryption standards, syslog standards, etc. These are intended to allow for a baseline of security standards that are compatible with most systems.
          This document assumes minimum support for encryption based on AES with a 128-bit key. Support for this algorithm and key size by all devices provides an interoperable cryptographic capability; however, devices may also support other algorithms and key sizes that provide the same or more cryptographic security.
          1.2.1 Level 1 IoT Cybersecurity Tests
          The Level 1 IoT security features are:
          Terms of Service and Privacy Policies – Device Terms of Service and privacy policy are readily available. The Terms of Service cover “end of life” for the device.
          Password Management – Device supports local password management and one-time password management
          Authentication – Device supports user authentication.
          Version 1.4

          Access Controls – Device enforces role-based access control.
          Patch Management – Device supports automatic and manual installation of patches from an authorized source.
          Software Upgrades – Device supports manual installation software upgrades from an authorized source.
          1.2.2 Level 2 IoT Cybersecurity Tests
          The Level 2 IoT security features expand on the Level 1 IoT security features and add:
          Audit Log – Device supports the gathering audit log events and reporting them to an EMS using IPsec, SSH, TLS, or DTLS for encryption and integrity protection.
          Encryption of Data in Transit – Device supports encrypted communications using IPsec, SSH, TLS or DTLS.
          Multi-Factor Authentication – Device supports multiple authentication factors.
          Remote Deactivation – Device can be remotely deactivated by the EMS.
          Secure Boot – Device supports a secure boot process to protect its hardware (e.g., UEFI).
          Threat Monitoring – Device supports logging of anomalous or malicious activity based on configured polices and rules.
          IoT Device Identity – Device provides an IoT Device Type and a globally unique IoT Device Identity.
          1.2.3 Level 3 IoT Cybersecurity Tests
          The Level 3 IoT security features expand on the Level 1 and Level 2 IoT security features and add:
          Encryption of Data at Rest– Device supports an effective mechanism for encrypting data stored on the device.
          Digital Signature Generation and Validation – Device supports generation and validation of digital signatures.
          Tamper Evidence – Device has the ability to alert a monitoring system when it is physically opened.
          Design-In Features – Device includes features to fail secure, provide boundary security, and ensure function isolation.
